# Automated_S3_File_Processing_with_AWS_Lambda
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture for processing files uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS Lambda. The architecture ensures that when a user uploads a file to the S3 bucket, it triggers a Lambda function to process the file and store the processed file in another S3 bucket.
